SQuAD 2.0 Question Answering Project
Overview
SQuAD 2.0, derived from Stanford's Question and Answering Dataset, presents a unique challenge with questions lacking answers. This project addresses the intricacies of designing a robust Question Answering (QA) system for reading comprehension. QA in natural language processing involves creating models that comprehend and respond to user queries by extracting relevant information from text or knowledge bases. Techniques such as information retrieval, knowledge-based approaches, semantic parsing, and machine learning play pivotal roles.

Approach
The primary objective is to develop an advanced QA system using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The methodology involves leveraging the pre-trained BERTForQuestionAnswering model and fine-tuning it on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset. Special attention is given to modifying the BERT architecture for the specific downstream task of question-answering. Various experiments are conducted to optimize model parameters for training.

Project Highlights
BERT Utilization: The project harnesses the power of BERT, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, for enhancing reading comprehension and question answering.

Fine-tuning: The BERTForQuestionAnswering model is fine-tuned on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset to tailor it for the specific challenges posed by questions without answers.

Architecture Modification: The project explores modifications to the BERT architecture to enhance its performance in the targeted task of question-answering.

Parameter Optimization: Rigorous experiments are conducted to fine-tune model parameters for optimal training and performance.

Evaluation and Analysis: Comparative evaluation is performed between the fine-tuned model and a model built from scratch. The results are analyzed to gain insights into the effectiveness of the developed QA system.
